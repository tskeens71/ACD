          <h3>Australian Cattle Dog Health Issues</h3>

<p>
Australian Cattle Dogs (ACDs) are generally a healthy and robust breed, but like all dogs, they are prone to certain health conditions. Responsible breeders take steps to minimize the risk of these conditions through careful breeding practices and health screenings.
<br><br>
Here are some of the common health issues seen in Australian Cattle Dogs:
<br><br>
1. Hip Dysplasia:
A genetic condition where the hip joint doesn't develop properly, leading to pain, lameness, and arthritis. Responsible breeders screen their dogs for hip dysplasia to reduce the risk of passing it on to offspring.
<br><br>
2. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA):
A group of inherited eye diseases that cause gradual vision loss and eventually blindness. While there is no cure, early detection can help manage the condition.
<br><br>
3. Deafness:
ACDs can be prone to congenital or acquired deafness. This is often associated with the merle coat pattern. Breeders can test for the gene responsible for deafness and avoid breeding dogs carrying the gene.
<br><br>
4. Elbow Dysplasia:
Similar to hip dysplasia, this condition affects the elbow joint. It can cause pain, lameness, and arthritis. Responsible breeders screen for elbow dysplasia to reduce the risk of passing it on.
<br><br>
5. Osteochondritis Dissecans (OCD):
A developmental bone disease affecting joints, especially the shoulder and elbow. It can cause pain and lameness.
